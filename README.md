Open-GL project boilerplate.

Basic scene with skybox and *poorly* textured "tree".

Simple shaders with diffuse lighting.

This project is intended to be reusable, to speed up my OpenGL project development


If you want to run it, just clone the repo, run ./build and then ./main

Dependencies are GLFW and GLEW in your /usr/include, and gcc.
I do not intend to port to windows
